				<p>
					<b>Revised:</b> July 4, 2023 (update summary and previous version)
					<br><br>
					These Terms of Use (the “Terms”), which incorporate our Privacy Policy, govern your access to and use of
					our services, including our various websites, such as zipjobs.com, applications, ads, communications,
					events, and other covered products or services that link to these Terms (collectively “services”). By
					accessing and using the services, you agree to comply with these Terms. If you're using the services on
					behalf of a company or other legal entity, then “you” also means such company or legal entity and you
					agree to be bound by these Terms even if we have a separate agreement with you. You may not use the
					services if you do not agree to the linked version of the Terms at the time you access the services.
					For the purposes of these Terms, “zipjobs,” means zipjobs, Inc.
					<br><br>
					<b>THESE TERMS REQUIRE THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN
						JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS, AND ALSO LIMIT THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO YOU IN THE EVENT OF A
						DISPUTE. SEE SECTION 12 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.</b>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="container text-center">
				<p>
					<b>1. Eligibility to Use the Services </b> <br><br>
					To access or use the services, you must be at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in your
					jurisdiction, if older, and not prohibited from doing so by applicable law. Except as set forth below,
					or as otherwise approved by us, the services are for your personal, non-commercial use unless you enter
					into a separate agreement with us for your commercial use. You may not use the services if we've
					terminated your account(s) or banned you. <br><br>
					<b>
						2. Communications
					</b><br><br>
					By creating an account, you agree to accept and receive communications from zipjobs, zipjobs
					affiliates, and our third-party service providers.
					<br>
					For the purposes of these Terms, “affiliates” means any entity that directly or indirectly controls, is
					controlled by, or is under common control of or with zipjobs, now or in the future. “Control” for
					these purposes means having a majority of shares or the right and ability to direct management.
					<br>
					These communications may be via email, text message, calls, push notifications, or otherwise. You
					understand and agree that you may receive communications generated by automatic telephone dialing
					systems delivering pre-recorded messages sent by or on behalf of zipjobs, its affiliates, and/or our
					third-party service providers, including communications concerning your account(s), our services, and
					services offered by our affiliates. Message and data rates may apply.
					<br>
				<ul>
					<li>To opt out of receiving text messages, you must reply “STOP” from the device receiving the messages.
					</li>
					<li>To unsubscribe from non-service-related emails, please use the unsubscribe or email settings link in
						the email(s) you receive. If you unsubscribe only from an individual type of email communication
						(e.g., a particular job alert), you will continue to receive other types of emails. We may also
						offer a settings function via our services to manage your email preferences.</li>
					<li>To turn off push notifications, use in-app and/or operating system settings on your device. </li>
				</ul>
				Unless you choose to delete your account(s), you cannot unsubscribe from certain communications that are
				required as part of your use of our services (e.g., communications about changes to these Terms.)
				</p>
			</div>

				<p>
					<b>
						3. Posting Jobs to the Services
					</b> <br><br>
					You may not post any job ad, as determined solely by zipjobs, that:
				<ol>
					<li>Does not comply with the applicable laws or regulations of the state and country where the job is to
						be performed, including laws relating to labor and employment, equal employment opportunity and
						employment eligibility requirements, data privacy, data access and use, and intellectual property;
					</li>
					<li>Contains false information or solicits employees by intentional misrepresentation, such as,
						misrepresentation of the terms of employment, the hiring entity, or the identity of the poster;</li>
					<li>Requires an application fee or up-front or periodic payments; requires recruitments of others;
						resembles a multi-level marketing scheme, franchise, pyramid scheme, “club membership”,
						distributorship or sales representative agency arrangement; only pays commissions (except where the
						listing makes clear that the available job pays commission only and clearly describes the product or
						service that the job seeker/user would be selling); or resembles a multi-level marketing scheme;
					</li>
					<li>Involves any screening requirement where such screening requirement is not an actual and legal
						requirement of the advertised position;</li>
					<li>Contains any logo or brands, or link to websites, other than your own or those of any entity for
						which you are authorized to submit job ads;</li>
					<li>Contains multiple job openings in a single job ad (unless you've purchased a service that permits
						this);</li>
					<li>Does not comply with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act or the EEOC's Enforcement Guidance on
						Employer's Consideration of Arrest and Conviction Records in Employment Decisions, and/or relevant
						national, federal, state, and local laws that prohibit employers from discriminating against people
						with criminal backgrounds and require employers to delay inquiry into an applicant's criminal
						history until later in the hiring process;</li>
					<li>Discriminates against applicants on the basis of gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, age,
						disability, or any other ground(s) prohibited by applicable law.</li>
				</ol>
				You agree that zipjobs may, at its sole discretion, remove or prevent the posting of any job ad for any or
				no reason.
				</p>
			</div>

				<p>
					<b>4. Removal of Content </b><br><br>
					While we have no obligation to do so, we reserve the right to review and remove any Content (or portion
					thereof) that we believe, in our sole discretion, violates these Terms or other applicable policies
					linked on the services (including our Community Guidelines), or that we deem, in our sole discretion,
					inappropriate.
					If you see any Content on the services that you believe violates our policies, you may report that
					Content by clicking on an applicable report link adjacent to that Content or by contacting us. Once
					notified, we will review the Content and consider whether to remove it (or a portion thereof).
					Please note: our interpretation of our policies and the decision whether or not to remove Content is
					within our sole discretion.
					You understand and agree that if we choose not to remove or edit Content that you find objectionable,
					that decision will not constitute a violation of these Terms or any agreement we have with you.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>
					<b>5. Other Enforcement Actions </b><br><br>
					While we have no obligation to do so, we reserve the right to investigate and take appropriate action in
					our sole discretion against you if you violate these Terms, including without limitation: removing
					Content (or portions thereof) from the services; suspending some or all of your rights to use the
					services; terminating your account(s); reporting you to law enforcement, regulatory authorities, or
					administrative bodies; and taking legal action against you.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>
					<b>6. Miscellaneous</b><br><br>
				<ul>
					<li>Except as specifically stated in another agreement we have with you, these Terms, and any other
						agreements, documents, or policies incorporated by reference in these Terms, constitute the entire
						agreement between you and us regarding the use of the services and these Terms supersede all prior
						proposals, negotiations, agreements, and understandings concerning the subject matter of these
						Terms. </li>
					<li>You represent and warrant that no person has made any promise, representation, or warranty, whether
						express or implied, not contained in these Terms to induce you to enter into this agreement. </li>
					<li>Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a
						waiver of such right or provision. </li>
					<li>If any provision of the Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, then only that provision
						shall be modified to reflect the parties' intention or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so
						that the Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. </li>
					<li>To the extent allowed by law, the English language version of these Terms are binding and any
						translations are provided for convenience only. </li>
					<li>The Terms, and any rights or obligations hereunder, are not assignable, transferable or
						sublicensable by you except with zipjobs's prior written consent, but may be assigned or
						transferred by us without restriction. Any attempted assignment by you shall violate these Terms and
						be void. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual
						effect. As used in these Terms, the word “including” means “including but not limited to.” </li>
				</ul>
